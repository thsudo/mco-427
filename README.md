# mco-427

This game is the final assignment for MCO 427. 

For this game, players will select a user profile and then be guided through a series of prompts by an "algorithm." These prompts are meant to (very loosely) mimic the experience that someone of that user profile would have online. The prompts will vary, all being guided by interests from the user and what the "algorithm" assumes they may be interested in, based on known information about them, such as the users age, and what others in a similar demographic are interested in. Based on how the player interacts, that will influence the next prompt, and so on.

At the end of the game, players will see how their chosen profile, user actions, and data that the game infers have guided what content the "algorithm" recommends them.

Below is an example of the terminal output once the game has completed.
